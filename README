This is a command-line tool to query the online encyclopedia of integer 
sequences, at oeis.org.  It's written in python so that, in principle, it can
be called programatically from within sage code.  Please read the user agreement of the online encyclopedia of integer sequences before using this code!

Functionality is currently very, very limited.  Syntax is

./oeis.py 1 2 5 14 42

or

./oeis.py -n4 1 2 5 14 42

to return only the first 4 responses.  If you want it to do other things, feel free to add them, but do send me a patch.
